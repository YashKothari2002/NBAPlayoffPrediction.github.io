            <p>
              This project aims to use a deep neural network to predict the NBA
              playoffs' ranked bracket. The model will be tested against 2
              baselines (gradient boosting and a randomized algorithm). The
              majority of previous approaches to NBA predictions have been
              focused on generating the playoff spread. This project
              differentiates itself by focusing on the ranked bracket for the
              playoffs. At the end of this project, we aim to be able to predict
              the ranked bracket for the 2021 playoffs.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The NBA is one of the top grossing sports in the United States,
            bringing in over $8 billion in revenue per year. As such, sports
            betting is a prominent aspect of American culture that engages
            millions of people nationwide. Engineering a prediction algorithm
            that can reliably produce insights about the outcomes of games would
            be of significance to consumers, the NBA franchise, opposition team
            analysis, and the gambling industry. As is common with any sport,
            the NBA has a dense collection of data and statistics ranging from
            points scored all the way to the number of blocks, assists, and
            steals made by every player. The unpredictability of the NBA is very
            likely due to our inability to accurately quantify players and
            performance metrics on the field. Through this project, we hope to
            understand which performance metrics and statistics are the major
            contributors to the overall game outcome.

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Each individual basketball game over the course of an NBAseason can
            be represented as a decision tree. There are’N’ number of input
            features - counting statistics - that canbe traversed over to
            eventually reach a binary outcome -Win for Team A or Win for Team B.
            Taking the sum overall results over a season for an arbitrary team
            ’A’, we canthen ”rank” teams in order of the number of total wins
            theyaccumulate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Input SpaceBasketball statistics data will be pulled from
            basketball-reference.com and espn.com/basketball/stats.Unique
            dataset will be created after performing statistical analysisof
            correlation between various stats and the impact on teamwin. Final
            dataset will be pre-processed using principalcomponent analysis
            (PCA) and mean-centering to reducedimensionality.

              <h2>Data Collection and Cleaning</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              To acquire the data, we decided to use data from ESPN and
              Basketball Reference. ESPN is a popular cable sports channel and
              Basketball Reference is one of the most popular databases for NBA
              history. As both of these sources are known to be reputable, we
              felt quite comfortable using them. Using Beautiful Soup python
              library we decided to webscrape NBA Regular Season Team Statistics
              and the NBA Playoffs Team Stats from the past 19 seasons
              (2001-2002 season to the 2019-2020 season). Novelty lies in
              combining the most impactful statistics on game results from
              multiple sources. The data provided team statistics such as
              3-point percentage, free-through percentage, points, assists,
              steals, etc for each season.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the images to the right, you can see our data cleaning process
              using the Annova Correlation Coefficient to determine feature
              importances and reduce dimensionality in order to use only the
              most important features
            </p>
            <p>
              We see that there is a F-test metric as well as a YES or NO binary
              classification for whether a feature was selected for our training
              (input) space or not. There is a way to threshold this F-metric to
              either accept (take) or reject (not take) the null hypothesis from
              the ANOVA test. Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates that
              variance exists between the two groups which, for this paper, are
              the feature (group 1) and the result of the game (group 2). A
              value of the F-test above a given threshold means that we would
              reject the null hypothesis for that particular feature and hence
              make it a part of the data-set that we use to train the model.
              This threshold is taken from the F-table, which is based on the
              feature space, degrees of freedom, etc. We have taken our
              threshold as 4.23 (derived from the F-table directly). The F-test
              threshold has been taken from the ANOVA table, which includes a
              value for significance above which features are statistically
              important enough to be considered in our dataset (final dataset).

              Mean Average Error Generally used as a variant of an error
              function for classification/regression problems. This has been
              used by our baseline models in the past and hence makes it easy
              for a comparative basis.

              Memory Feedback:The memory of predictions for results of past
              games and the error in those predictions will be recurrently fed
              into our deep network as double-verification (since our network
              performs two functions simultaneously).

              Rank Performance: The final output of our prediction algorithm
              produces a ranked matrix ordered by the percentage of wins each
              team had during a particular season. In order to compare predicted
              ranked brackets to the true rank, we use the KendallTau statistic
              which outputs the association between two ranked lists. We can use
              this metric to evaluate the final result and give it a score.

            <p>
              Using 50 trees with a max depth of 3. We see good clustering at
              the winners and losers of the season when comparing to the true
              results. This shows that while the model wasn't very accurate at
              predicting individual games, it did a decent job in identifying
              the strong winners and losers of the game, and had trouble in
              ranking those in the middle.

              <h2>Future Work and Conclusion</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Utilizing grid search to fine-tune the hyper parameters forthe
              model is one area of improvement that can be made -which could
              potentially boost the performance of the modelfurther.
              Additionally, augmenting the data set with individ-ual player data
              that rolls over as rosters change within theNBA is a potential
              area of focus for further work, giventhat the impact of changing
              rosters on wins/losses is sig-nificant as it can potentially
              strengthen or weaken a teamsignificantly. Additionally, some
              further predictions shouldbe made with this model (ie it should be
              tested on futureseasons) to ensure that our accuracy/results are
              not due toany kind of over-fitting for a particular type of
              season. Fur-thermore, there can be more feature pruning done to
              removesome redundant/non-independent features from the data setas
              well, or some form of feature weighting to be done
              withinpre-processing the data
            </p>
            <p>
              The project’s success was definitely measured based on how well
              our model can learn to predict results. However,the overarching
              goal of this project is to be able to come up with a more
              comprehensive result of statistical featuresthat impact the
              outcome of a game. The usage of data as abasis for information is
              prevalent in sports. If we are able to identify a dataset of
              basketball counting statistics thatcan be said to span the most
              important features impacting winning, this would be a huge
              success. Our first attempt with random forest showed poor
              performance results andthrough research we decided to use gradient
              boosting as a replacement. Through this project, we've learned how
              to analyze and reduce the dimensionality of the feature space
              using statistical techniques to recognize feature importances. We
              were able to see a significant improvement of the NBA ranking from
              the original randomized algorithm, showing that our algorithm was
              indeed creating intelligent predictions past simply randomly
              predictions. We were also able to understand and effictively
              utilize appropriate metrics to analyze our findings. All these
              skills have given us a strong foundation for approaching and
              solving a machine learning problem.
